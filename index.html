        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Leslie Gomez im an 18 year old Mexican-American who was born in California. I attend the University of California Riverside majoring in Education, currently a freshman so I don't have that much professional experience. I knew I wanted to be an Education major when I was about 6 years old. My cousin would always come over on the weekends and we would always play school and since I was the oldest I always choose to be the teacher. I liked the process of teaching them new stuff like math and new words. Later on they thanked me because they were much ahead than their other classmates once they entered preschool.<br><br>

        At some point in middle school I did almost change my career path when I began to get bullied and my parents' situation at home was not looking too good. I began to grow a hatred for learning and everyone at school including the teachers. It wasn't until my 8th grade year where I met two teachers Mrs.Braesch and Mrs.Lamb. Mrs.Braesch would always let me into her room in the morning and during lunch because I only had 1 friend and she was absent very frequently and would recommend me some books and advice about life. I began to grow a connection and without her I probably would not have been in the state of mind I am right now and would have gone through the hole of depression. As for Mrs.Lamb she taught and showed my worth as a student. I never thought I was smart I didnt think I was dumb either. If I was a movie I was not the main character or the second lead I was an extra. Mrs.Lam acknowledged that I was intelligent and presented me to opportunities such as having all honors classes once I entered high school. That 8th grade year was the first time in a while I began to feel happiness with learning again it was also the first time ever of me receiving a 4.0 GPA..<br><br>

        Although I am barely starting with my professional experience as a future educator I am adapting to a new learning environment to which I am very excited for meeting new classmates and learning new cultures that are around me. Learning the academic struggles they went through in their life and how they got through it. Why they decided to take this path in the first place. I want to be able to have as much knowledge not just on the basic education such as english,math, history and science but more topics that are relevant to students outside their school life because just like how my teachers, Ms.Braesch and Mrs.Lamb did for me I want to have an impact and show them that even though things might seem really bad and things are not going your favor that just around the corner there so much more opportunities and people that can get you through what you're going through. I hope to in the future once coronavirus has calmed down and there is a secure vaccine given to everyone around the world to learn and educate in other parts of the world as well, not just in the usa or my parents homeland of Mexico.
